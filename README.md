# Software Requirement

The following softwares are required to run the software

- Php
- Phpmyadmin

# Database creation
To run our project, complete the following steps:
1. Create the database in phpMyAdmin by copying the DB2.sql instructions into the "SQL" tab
2. Open the "bookstore" database by clicking on the "Databases" tab
3. Populate the "bookstore" tables by copying the dml/insert.sql instructions into the "SQL" tab
4. You can now run the index.php file, as long as all the PHP code found in /php/ is located in the same directory as the index.php file. This file contains a UI to all of the queries, and links to the different php files that run the selected query. 
NOTE: the index.php file is our "HTML" file, we just made it a PHP file so we could embed PHP scripts easily.
